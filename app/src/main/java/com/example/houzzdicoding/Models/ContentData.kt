            "The modern bathroom design is simply defined by its look. Straight, clean lines, uncluttered counter spaces and geometric shapes dominate the landscape. Modern design takes quite a departure from the antique and ornate detailed traditional interior design theme—in fact, the concept is exactly the opposite. Modern design is often confused with contemporary design but actually there is a distinct difference between the two.",
            "Modern bathroom designs were so popular as they offered a departure from the warm and cozy wooden Victorian design themes prevalent at the time. Over the decades, other cultures around the world began to develop a taste for the look and feel of simple elegance that is modern design.\n" + "But what really defines a modern bathroom design theme? Besides the look and feel of sleek cool lines and simple colour palates with neutral tones, modern design elements often go hand in hand with organization. A well-organized space with minimal décor clutter and clever storage solutions screams modern bathroom design.",
            "Accenting with bright and bold colours is also a feature that is often used in modern bathroom designs. While the greys, browns and tans of the moderns design reflect the industrial overtones of the theme, bold and bright splashes of red, green, yellow and blue are always welcome. However, when using colors that contrast with the neutral tones of a bright colour, be sure they line up correctly on the colour wheel or else you could have a bad colour match that makes the bold colour stand out too much rather than make a nice accent.",
            "In the basis of the style modern are clear lines, simplicity, comfort, lightness and unobtrusiveness. Palette often contains white, black colors and neutral shades, while bright accents are also welcome. The main element of any contemporary interior is graphic lines, free space, minimum number of decor elements and furniture items. Despite the external strictness and clarity, the modern style can be also cosy and comfortable for everyday life.",
            "Materials from which made the bedroom’s furniture in the modern style can be quite different. The amount of furniture in the room will depend on, whether it is used only modern or a combination of two styles. In the first case it welcomes the presence of a bed and chest of drawers, a bedside table and mirror, a wardrobe. The furniture can be decorated with floral motives in combinations with other styles. The combination of different materials looks perfectly. As an additional item of furniture it is possible to use an armchair.",
            "Accessories in the bedroom in modern style can be used, but their number should be varied according to the room’s size. It is better to use for additional decorative elements such materials as porcelain and wood, metal, stone and glass. Elegant decorations will fit to the real modern style. Lightning sources can be several lights at once. It is good if they have a fancy shape like some animal or plant. You can decorate the bedroom with a mirror in a large frame, paintings of wide format printing.",
            "Particleboard countertops are laminated in plastic; its height varies from 0.8 to 1.2 mm. The coverage consists of several layers, saturated with special mastics and highly compressed. The upper layer is an enduring polymer; its layout is responsible for aesthetics properties of items. The advantage of such countertops is that they have various colour modifications: they can be matted or glazed, can imitate wood or stone. The plastic`s height, particleboard`s quality and external properties greately influence the price of the ready-made item. However, there is essential price dispersion even within such low-priced category of countertops.",
            "It is fair to say that such countertops are the most popular ones nowadays. These items consist of plywood with glued layer of artificial stone of around 12 mm in height. The artificial stone in turn is by nature of polymer adhesive with granules of different colour and size, imitating the natural material. Such end material is rather flexible and allows creation of complicated forms; this is often necessary for kitchen furniture with bent facades.An artificial stone is light-weight, smooth and warm, as against the natural one. One of the main advantages of such type of countertops is that you may build up large surfaces without junctions, to cut a hole for sinks or other elements. Countertops of artificial stone will work for a long time in case the technological process has not been breached and the producer hasn`t cut down expenses on components. Therefore our advice is to give preference to famous brands, which gained a good reputation during many years.",
            "These countertops are the most expensive and beautiful. It`s obvious that no imitation could be compared to the natural ornament on the stone. However, this will cost a lot. The thing is not only in cost of the stone itself. The Natural-stoned countertops weight a lot; their mounting will require the reinforced frame of kitchen cupboards of the lower level. Apart from the heavy weight and high price there are other disadvantages of some kinds of natural stone. Thus, marble looks splendid and is able to transfigure even the most ordinary interior. However, it is not functional as a countertop material; it is easily scratched (requires frequent polishing) and fouled (high water absorbency).",
            "The first original idea is to use photo wallpapers with the scene matching the overall design of the living room as a decoration of the free wall. For example, this could be a fascinating and stylish view of a night city with glowing lights. An image of a city street in the retro style will emphasize the classic features of the interior. And for creating of futuristic atmosphere you can include some space patterns on wallpaper.",
            "Lambrequin is a decorative element, which is located in front of the curtain and is used for hiding of a curtain-rod. However, apart from this function lambrequin could be successfully used for visual raise of ceilings and shift in windows` proportions. Lambrequin may be soft and hard. Soft is sewn directly on the curtain and is only a decorative element in such a case. In turn, the hard one is fixed to the wall above the curtain-rod, hides it and visually corrects the window`s size.",
            "Color tincture of curtains may be compliant with other interior colors, yet must necessarily be light (beige, white coffee, ivory) or should make emphasizes (red, violet, light-blue, green). In any case these colors should be pure and pristine. The curtains in modern style may be manufactured of any fabric:  starting from natural one with pronounced texture, to the fabric, produced with the use of modern technologies (metallic threads, laser beam cutting etc.). The ornament may be either sole-colored or contain geometric figures.",
            "Unlike most dining rooms, this one by Leanne Ford Interiors doesn't use a large pendant light as the focal point. Instead, the focus is on the space itself. To enhance the beauty of a space like this one, work with raw materials like concrete, jute, and wood, and keep those beams exposed. An abstract painting in light clay tones elevates the dining nook even more. ",
            "This moody dining room designed by Anne Pyne proves that formal doesn't necessarily mean fussy. Rich jewel one fabrics and lush layers of patterns bring the room to life, but they're used with restraint so the modern art gallery-esque table and light fixture can also assert a more edgy and serious tone. ",
            "When your formal dining room is also your everyday dining area, invest in pieces that fuse form and function. This built-in velvet banquette by Abdan Idza is cozy and comfortable, but it also looks dressy. The same is true for those beautiful barrel chairs. And unusual lighting and wallpaper are easy ways to add character without taking up surface space.",
            "The combination of all these factors affects how people see the landscape (bright, clear desert distances; soft, mysterious, changeable foggy landscapes), what they expect from design (shade from the sun, protection from the wind, shelter from rain and snow), and how gardens and landscapes are designed. The patios, cloisters, and oases of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions, the romantic naturalistic parks of Europe, China, and eastern North America, the esoteric garden abstractions of Japan—all of these different approaches to design were inspired partly by the particular qualities of the landscape climate in which they developed.",
            "The pond was also designed to provide an ideal environment for koi and other aquatic life. The site was excavated to a depth of only 2 feet, but its reinforced concrete walls are covered with a black waterproof coating to create the illusion of deeper water. An underground drain pipe system leads to a filter and an above-ground mechanical pump hidden by a cinder block wall covered with vines. To help move and oxygenate the water, the Niemans installed a rock waterfall and other water statuary, which work in unison with the pump system to maintain good water quality for the pond’s many visitors.",
            "For flower lovers, a charming white-picketed garden area shows off raised beds full of colorful wildflowers, perennials, and annuals, including nasturtiums, cosmos, Peruvian lilies, snapdragons, daisy’s, delphiniums, and calla lilies. “Something is always in bloom, providing color all year round in the sunny San Diego climate.A garden sign that insinuates dragons are nearby is one of the many whimsical items in the yard, added for the delight of visiting grandchildren.",
            "Succulents are popular among plant enthusiasts because they are space efficient, colorful, and very easy to maintain. Succulents are also fire-resistant and are great alternatives if you are in a region with a lot of water shortages. For this reason, succulents are great plant choices for vertical gardens.Succulents are well known to have a hard and fleshy exterior which makes them great candidates for interiors. Selecting succulents makes it very easy to mold and shape any vertical garden to your needs. Watering and other maintenance is needed less for succulents while they provide a wonderful aesthetic to any space.",
            "Vertical gardening is used by many as a means to ensure they are using their garden space to its maximum potential. A simple structure formed by bamboo poles can allow bean plants to climb vertically, providing more growing space than would be possible in a conventional horizontal garden. Cucumbers, squash, and even tomatoes can be grown vertically, as well.Climbing plants and vines are far from the only options when it comes to vertical gardening. With a little planning and the right materials, vertical gardens can be created that allow you to grow virtually anything. A number of DIY kits can be found that use small cups or other containers set in rows in the face of a vertical support. These containers are filled with soil and seeds, and then watered. ",
            "The building block of this modular system is a rigid, light weight, three-dimensional panel made from a powder coated galvanized and welded steel wire that supports plants with both a face grid and a panel depth. This system is designed to hold a green facade off the wall surface so that plant materials do not attach to the building, provides a “captive” growing environment for the plant with multiple supports for the tendrils, and helps to maintain the integrity of a building membrane. Panels can be stacked and joined to cover large areas, or formed to create shapes and curves, are made from recycledcontent steel and are recyclable. Because the panels are rigid, they can span between structures and can also be used for freestanding green walls.",
